    "Now that the party is jumping. With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumping. Quick to the point, to the point, no faking. Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon. Burning them, if you ain't quick and nimble. I go crazy when I hear a cymbal. And a hi hat with a souped up tempo. I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo.",
    "Don't stop me now. I'm having such a good time. I'm having a ball. Don't stop me now. If you wanna have a good time. Just give me a call.",
    "Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.",
    "Now, who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores? You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop? Whose jewels got rocks? Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?",
    "His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs.",
    "Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin. I came to win, battle me that's a sin. I won't ever slack up, punk you better back up.",
    "A seven foot frame, rats along his back. When he calls your name, it all fades to black. Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams."
